# Cpp_To_MySQL_Connection_CRUD
This repository contains c++ code that allows you to connect to a mySQL database and perform CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

The movies.sql file is a table that the program was designed for, it's a basic database that stores a list of movies.
By putting the movies.sql table on your server and changing "CONNECTION DATA" to match it 
(it is currently configured to work on a localhost database)
you'll be able to connect to your mySQL database 
with a commandline program written in C++ and you'll be able to do basic management of it.

You can easily change the code to work with a different database, 
just edit the inputs inside functions and the strings that include the queries to match your needs.
